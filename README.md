Base DeFi Yield Farming

📋 Project Description
Base DeFi Yield Farming is a decentralized finance platform that allows users to stake tokens and earn passive income through yield farming mechanisms. The platform provides multiple liquidity pools with varying reward structures and risk profiles.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Solidity 0.8.0
Framework: Hardhat
Network: Base Network
Standards: ERC-20, ERC-721
Libraries: OpenZeppelin, Chainlink

🚀 Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/base-defi-yield-farming.git
cd base-defi-yield-farming
2. Install dependencies
npm install
3. Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile
4. Run tests
npx hardhat test
5. Deploy to Base network

💰 Features
Core Functionality:
✅ Token staking with yield rewards
✅ Multiple liquidity pools
✅ Automated reward distribution
✅ Flexible staking periods
✅ Withdrawal flexibility
✅ Real-time reward calculation
Advanced Features:
Dynamic APR - Variable annual percentage rates
Multi-Token Support - Support for various token types
Liquidity Mining - Additional rewards for liquidity provision
Governance Voting - Community-driven protocol decisions
Risk Management - Built-in risk assessment tools


🛠️ Smart Contract Functions
Core Functions:
stake(address token, uint256 amount) - Stake tokens for rewards
unstake(address token, uint256 amount) - Withdraw staked tokens
claimRewards(address token) - Claim accumulated rewards
createPool(address token, uint256 rewardRate) - Create new liquidity pool
getPendingRewards(address user, address token) - Check pending rewards
Events:
Staked - Emitted when tokens are staked
Unstaked - Emitted when tokens are unstaked
RewardsClaimed - Emitted when rewards are claimed
PoolCreated - Emitted when new pool is created


📊 Contract Structure
Pool Structure:
struct Pool {
    address token;
    uint256 totalStaked;
    uint256 rewardPerSecond;
    uint256 lastUpdateTime;
    uint256 accRewardPerShare;
}
User Structure:
struct UserInfo {
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 rewardDebt;
}
